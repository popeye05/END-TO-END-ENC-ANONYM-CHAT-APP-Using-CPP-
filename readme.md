This Project is a Modern C++ Project, it uses the concept of Socket Programming.
By the time , Ive done this project, I didnt actually know what Socket Programming, infact, it may happen, when youre reading this, I still dont know how its actually done, because probably I wont be in that domain at all, but why did I chose this ?
The Answer is quite simple actually. Curiosity, How these applications work? and just by C++, in which im programming for 6 months!??? "Lets try this out", I said.
and thats it... 
By the time i was done with this project, I must say, I started to get what socket programming is , and the time was worth it!
